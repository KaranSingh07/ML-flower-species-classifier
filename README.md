# **Flower Species Classifier**
## A Supervised Machine Learning Classification Project
    By Karan Singh Solanki as ShapeAI ML Bootcamp Project

### Algorithm used: [K-nearest neighbour (KNN)](https://youtu.be/SQ84-3uwKLk?t=3007)
### Dataset used: iris_dataset (iris plants dataset) of sklearn datasets
### Description...
- It takes data of various flowers, each flower having length of petals and sepals (part of a flower).
- Each flower is labelled with its species, there are total of 3 species (or classes)
- This model learns from the data of flowers and their species

### The task is, whenever a new flower data is given to the model, it should predict the species of the new flower.

### **Note:** The "ML Flower Species Classifier K-Nearest Neighbour.ipynb" and "main.py" are same code. The former is with a good explanation of what's going on with proper documentation and explanation. The latter is only python code without any documentation
